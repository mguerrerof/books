    "description": "The groundbreaking first book of an epic series that has changed the face of fantasy. The Way of Kings begins The Stormlight Archive. Speak again the ancient oaths: Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before Destination. Return to men the Shards they once bore. The Knights Radiant must stand again. Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable. Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity. Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.

    "description": "Una gran novela que narra las vidas de cinco familias: una americana, una galesa, una inglesa, una alemana y una rusa, con el trasfondo de la Primera Guerra Mundial, la Revolución Rusa y los profundos cambios sociales que estas conllevaron. Primer volumen de la trilogía «The Century» La historia empieza en 1911, el día de la coronación del rey Jorge V en la abadía de Westminster. El destino de los Williams, una familia minera de Gales, está unido por el amor y la enemistad al de los Fitzherbert, aristócratas y propietarios de las minas. Lady Maud Fitzherbert se enamorará de Walter von Ulrich, un joven espía en la embajada alemana en Londres. Sus vidas se entrelazarán con la de un asesor progresista del presidente de Estados Unidos, Woodrow Wilson, y la de dos hermanos rusos a los que la guerra y la revolución les ha arrebatado su sueño de buscar fortuna en América. Desde Washington hasta San Petesburgo, desde la inmundicia y los peligros de las minas de carbón hasta los candelabros lujosos de los palacios de la aristocracia, pasando por los pasillos de la Casa Blanca y el parlamento de Westminster, Ken Follet nos ofrece, en su novela más ambiciosa, un esmerado retrato de una época y de las pasiones que espolearon la vida de sus personajes. «La trilogía \"The Century\" es la historia de mis abuelos y de los vuestros, de nuestros padres y de nuestras vidas. De alguna forma es la historia de todos nosotros.» Ken Follet La crítica ha dicho... «Alta política y bajas pasiones (y viceversa) conforman un folletín de grandes dimensiones que confirma a Follett como relojero mayor del reino del best seller.» Qué Leer «Ken Follett no es un escritor, sino un fenómeno social.» El Cultural de El Mundo",
